            <h2>MIssile Man of india</h2>
            <p><b>Avul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam </b>was born on 15 October 1931, to a Tamil Muslim family in the
                pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island, then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of
                Tamil Nadu. His father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a local mosque;[9] his mother
                Ashiamma was a housewife.[10][11][12][13] His father owned a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and
                forth between Rameswaram and the now uninhabited Dhanushkodi.[14][15] Kalam was the youngest of four
                brothers and one sister in his family.[16][17][18] His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and
                landowners, with numerous properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found
                in coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women. The family
                business had involved trading groceries between the mainland and the island and to and from Sri Lanka,
                as well as ferrying pilgrims between the mainland and Pamban. With the opening of the Pamban Bridge to
                the mainland in 1914, however, the businesses failed and the family fortune and properties were lost by
                the 1920s, apart from the ancestral home. The family was poverty-stricken by the time Kalam was born. As
                a young boy he had to sell newspapers to add to the family's meager income. [19][20][21]</p>
